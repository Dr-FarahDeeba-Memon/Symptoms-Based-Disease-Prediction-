# Symptoms-Based-Disease-Prediction

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.

Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:

Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

Dataset
Source-1
The dataset for this problem used with the main.py script is downloaded from here:

The dataset for this problem used with the Jupyter notebook is downloaded from here:

https://impact.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html
This dataset has 3 columns:

Disease  | Count of Disease Occurrence | Symptom
You can either copy paste the whole table from here to an excel sheet or scrape it out using Beautifulsoup.
